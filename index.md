Welcome! I'm Omkar.

I'm curious about anything and everything that involves thinking. I also enjoy a lot of things that don't require thinking.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering with a Minor in Quant Finance from the <a href="https://www.coeptech.ac.in/">College of Engineering Pune</a>. I'm interested in working on topics in computer vision, robotics, machine learning, remote sensing and math. <br>

During my engineering days, I was part of the <a href="">COEP Rowing Crew</a> and I participated in the 94th and 95th Regattas. Falling into the Mutha river right on the warf is one of my achievements. <br>

I ~~rarely~~ write Computer Science blogs on <a href="">Medium</a>. For fun blogs visit [here](blogs). 

In my free time, you will find me reading Japanese newspapers or writing Kanji in a cute square notebook. Nonetheless, I am equally bad at both. <br>

Occasionally, I also enjoy climbing mountains and listening to classical music.
