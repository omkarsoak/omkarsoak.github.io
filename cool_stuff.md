- **On C++**: _"There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses."_ -- [Bjarne Stroustrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup)

- **On Computer Science**: _"Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes"_ -- [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://github.com/sarabander/sicp-pdf)

- **Stigler's law** states that _no Discovery is ever actually named after the first person to discover it. Appropriately, Stephen Stigler was not the first person to notice this (it was Robert Merton, though doubtlessly someone else noticed before him too)_ and so the name "Stigler's law" is an example of Stigler's law.

- **Addition to Hilbert's Slogan**: _"We must know. We will know. But the truth is we don't know."_ -- [Math's Fundamental Flaw, Veritasium](https://youtu.be/HeQX2HjkcNo?si=Bkob8Q6lj6kouNhP)

- **On Familiarity**: _"It took me some time to realize why I keep coming back to this place. To the attendant, in her spectacles, and face-mask. To the small enclosure contained within those four walls with their white paint tearing up in some places. To the servers, with their plates, and to the food topped with Ghee. I was looking for a word, a feeling to explain this behavior. I know what it is now. Familiarity."_  -- [Ghee Sakhar, by Mihir Jain](https://mihirjain.blogspot.com/2023/11/ghee-shakar.html)
