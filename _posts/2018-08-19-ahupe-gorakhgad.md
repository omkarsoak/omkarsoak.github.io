The clock struck 4:30 AM as I slung my backpack over my shoulders and set out towards Fergusson gate. The city streets were eerily quiet, a stark contrast to the adventure that lay ahead. A bus ride through winding roads and mist-laden hills brought us to Ahupe, our starting point. The air smelled fresh, tinged with the dampness of monsoon showers. <br>
After a hearty breakfast of misal and hot tea at a small eatery in Manchar, we reached Ahupe village at 9:30. We tightened our shoelaces and began our descent from the Ahupe Ghat. The trail was slippery from the morning rain, each step requiring careful footing. After two and a half hours of trekking, we reached a river. The water was knee-deep and gushing with force, but there was no turning back. With cautious but exhilarated steps, we waded through, our clothes soaked to the thighs. From the other side, Gorakhgad loomed in the distance, its sharp pinnacle piercing through the drifting clouds.

As the rain picked up again, we decided to have lunch by the river, sheltering under whatever trees we could find. Rainwater trickled down our faces as we munched on our packed meals, the chill creeping into our bones. But spirits remained high. By 3:20 PM, we reached the Gorakshanath Mandir, a small temple nestled in the hills. Inside, a furry puppy was curled up in a corner, oblivious to the pilgrims and trekkers who sought refuge here. As dusk set in, our group gathered for an small Aarti. The rhythmic chants and flickering oil lamps filled the air with an almost mystical energy. Soon after, we got to work preparing khichdi for dinner. The warmth of the meal, combined with shared laughter, was enough to fend off the cold. We huddled together, recounting stories from previous treks before drifting off to sleep. <br>

The next morning, we woke up at dawn, energized for the final ascent. After a quick breakfast, we set off towards Gorakhgad’s summit. The initial climb was straightforward, but soon we reached a the inclined slippery stone steps. We fixed a rope and carefully maneuvered upwards, one step at a time. Above us, the ancient stone steps of Gorakhgad stood formidable. The last stretch tested both endurance and willpower, but by 9:45 AM, we had conquered the peak.<br>

At the summit, a small Hanuman temple stood as a silent witness to countless climbers who had stood where we did now. The panoramic view was breathtaking—rolling green valleys, distant peaks shrouded in mist, and the ever-present monsoon clouds weaving through the landscape. We sat in awe, letting the moment sink in. <br>

Descending was equally thrilling, and by 3 PM, we found ourselves back at the Gorakshanath Mandir. A quick snack later, we traced our way back to the base, catching the bus home. As we finally reached Pune by 10 PM, drenched and exhausted, one thought lingered—this wasn’t just a trek; it was an experience etched in time and memory.
