The weather app showed 18 degrees (and a bright sun), as we were taking the right turn on N1 towards Johannesburg. We quickly got away from the towering might of Table Mountain constantly overlooking us and left the beatiful city of Cape Town behind. 

The drive from Cape Town to Stellenbosch albeit a short one, offers peace and tranquilty especially on a sunny day. (please bear with my extreme attraction to sunny weather)
